## Modern Day Record Player

This homemade record player allows you to place an album cover ontop of the box, and it will automatically start playing the desired album. 

To do this, the record player used Radio-frequency identification (RFID), the same technology in your credit card when you tap to pay, and in access cards you scan to enter restricted buildings. This technology usually involves RFID chips such as in your credit card, and an RFID scanner such as a debit machine that can read the values of the card when it is tapped and perform an action accordingly.

In this project, the RFID scanner module is mounted inside the wooden box, and the vinyls all have an RFID sticker that can be tapped on the box to switch the album. Inside the box, the RFID scanner is wired to a Raspberry Pi, which is running a python program that switches the song based on the value it reads from the RFID scanner. Depending on the RFID sticker value, the corresponding album is played through the Spotify API.
